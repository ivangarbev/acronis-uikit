# @acronis-platform/design-tokens

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#272](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/272) [`d95fc1e`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/d95fc1e809f3f4fe0c62f0c92d0f48b81976765d) Thanks [@heygabecom](https://github.com/heygabecom)! - # `1.0.0` — first stable token release

  This is the first stable (`1.0.0`) release of the published token packages. It
  consolidates the entire `feature/design-tokens-update` line of work into one
  release rather than a chain of pre-`1.0` patch/minor bumps. Treat the prior
  `0.x` token JSON and `tokens-pd` output as superseded: paths, value shapes, and
  generated CSS variable names have all changed since the last published `0.x`.

  The two packages move in lockstep — `tokens-pd` is fully regenerated from
  `design-tokens` by `tools/style-dictionary`, so every `design-tokens` change
  below is reflected in the corresponding `tokens-pd` artifacts.

  ## `@acronis-platform/design-tokens` (→ `1.0.0`)

  ### Token value shape — native DTCG dimensions (BREAKING)
  - Dimension tokens (`$type: "dimension"` — `units.*`, `font.font-size`,
    `font.line-height`, `font.letter-spacing`, and every component dimension)
    now carry a **native DTCG** `$value: { value, unit }` (unit `px`/`rem`).
  - The custom `$extensions.com.acronis.units` value carrier (and its short-lived
    `{ components, dimensionSpace }` intermediate) is **removed**. Dimensions no
    longer stash their value in `$extensions`.
  - `fontWeight` and `fontFamily` are scalar DTCG types and carry a plain
    `$value` — a `number` for weight, a `string`/array for family — not a
    dimension object.
  - The schema descriptions were updated to native DTCG language to match.

  ### Schema file renamed `tokens.schema.json` → `tier.schema.json` (BREAKING)

  The validating schema moved from `schemas/tokens.schema.json` to
  `schemas/tier.schema.json`. It describes the structure of a whole **tier file**
  (`tiers/*.json`) — how tokens are grouped and nested within a tier, not just a
  single token — so the name now reflects what it validates.
  - The `$schema` value embedded in every tier file is now
    `"../schemas/tier.schema.json"` (the schema enforces this exact string as a
    `const`, so the file and its tier data move in lockstep).
  - The schema's own `$id` is updated to match.
  - Consumers that reference the schema by path (or key off the `$schema`
    discriminator string) must update to `tier.schema.json`. The package's
    `exports` map already exposes `./schemas/*`, so the import subpath simply
    changes filename.

  ### Transparent rule (BREAKING for affected leaves)

  A fully-transparent color (`alpha: 0`) is emitted as the CSS keyword
  `transparent` instead of an HSL object. Figma stores zero-alpha colors with
  arbitrary channels (often a magenta placeholder), so the RGB channels are
  meaningless. This applies to `palette.transparent.*` primitives and any
  component literal color at `alpha: 0`.

  ### Naming — camelCase aligned with Figma (BREAKING)

  Token segment names are kept **verbatim from Figma** (camelCase), no longer
  kebab-converted by the emitter:
  - `on surface` → `onSurface`, `on brand` → `onBrand`, etc. (all `on *` groups).
  - `status-strong` → `statusStrong`.
  - Component/SubComponent names stay PascalCase (e.g. `MenuItemList`).

  Note: the generated CSS custom-property names are unaffected — Style Dictionary
  kebab-cases path segments into variable names, so `--ui-…-on-surface-…` is
  preserved for consumers.

  ### Tiers rebuilt from Figma (BREAKING)
  - **Semantics** (`tiers/semantic.json` → `tiers/semantics.json`, renamed):
    added the build-time `com.acronis.tailwindRoles` routing extension; removed
    the `brand-b` values mode; renamed token paths; deleted obsolete tokens;
    relocated the four AI gradients to a top-level `gradients.*` root, and a
    gradient-valued border (`border.onStatus.ai-strong`) now resolves through a
    proper `{gradients.ai.idle}` alias rather than a literal CSS string.
  - **Components** (`tiers/components.json`): rebuilt from Figma's
    `Brand/components` group; the `Input` component was renamed to `InputText`
    (the entire `input.*` namespace → `input-text.*`); added `breadcrumb`,
    `checkbox`, `switch`, `tag`; component-level typography tokens now correctly
    carry `$type: "typography"` so they render as `.typography-*` utility classes
    (previously emitted as malformed CSS variables).
  - **Primitives** (`tiers/primitives.json`): added the Ink palette ramp and the
    `size-20` unit.

  ### Formatting — emitter owns tier format
  - All tier JSON (`tiers/*.json`) and the `tokens-pd/dtcg/*` mirrors are now
    **fully alphabetically ordered** (numeric keys stay numeric); the emitter's
    formatter matches the prior Prettier line/inline conventions (printWidth 80).
  - `tiers/` is added to `.prettierignore` so the emitter — not Prettier — owns
    the on-disk format.

  ### Sync pipeline

  The `/figma-to-design-tokens` skill (a self-contained pipeline: pull →
  snapshot-build → diff → emit, with a human-reviewable diff gate) replaces the
  legacy temporary pull scripts as the canonical token-sync path.

  ### Context docs — removed `brand-matrix.md`

  `context/brand-matrix.md` is deleted. It carried information that was untrue,
  out of scope for this data-only package, or already owned by another context
  file:
  - **Wrong vocabulary.** It called the `light` / `dark` axis a "Color mode",
    but `glossary.md` defines that axis as **Theme** — reusing an established
    term with a different meaning.
  - **Out-of-scope implementation details.** It referenced the legacy `--av-*`
    CSS prefix and the `oklch` color space; CSS variable names and the output
    color space are the translation tool's concern, not the token data.
  - **Out-of-scope "Delivery model".** Emitted stylesheets, override-only files,
    and `light-dark()` composition belong to
    `@acronis-platform/style-dictionary` → `@acronis-platform/tokens-pd`, not to
    the data package.
  - **Untrue / unmaintained roadmap content.** The "Brand override surface" table
    (keyed by `--ui-*` output variables) and "The matrix" (a speculative list of
    ~22 legacy brands with partner mappings and guessed dark-mode columns) were
    unverified planning material, not properties of the token data.
  - **Misplaced how-to.** "Adding a brand" belongs in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

  The accurate, in-scope idea — the Brand axis is data-driven and adding a brand
  is purely additive — is already covered by `glossary.md`, `manifest.md`, and
  `token-contract.md`; references within the design-owned packages are updated in
  the same change.

  ***

  ## `@acronis-platform/tokens-pd` (→ `1.0.0`)

  Full regeneration from `@acronis-platform/design-tokens`. All generated CSS,
  Tailwind presets, and the DTCG mirror reflect every change above.
  - **CSS custom properties**: `--ui-input-*` renamed to `--ui-input-text-*`
    (Input → InputText); new per-component artifacts for `breadcrumb`,
    `checkbox`, `switch`, `tag`; component typography now emits `.typography-*`
    classes.
  - **Transparent**: fully-transparent colors render as the `transparent`
    keyword (`light-dark(transparent, transparent)`), never `rgb(… / 0)`.
  - **Native DTCG**: the Style Dictionary preprocessor passes native
    `$value: { value, unit }` through directly (the custom-carrier normalization
    step is gone); the DTCG mirror is written deep-sorted to match the source
    tiers.
  - **Tailwind**: role-restricted presets regenerated; component color roles are
    routed from the leaf via the data-driven `com.acronis.tailwindRoles` map; keys
    are normalized to lowercase kebab-case.
  - **Gradients**: data-driven gradient rebuild (AI gradients sourced from
    `gradients.*`).

  ## Migration
  - Update any reference to `--ui-input-*` CSS variables to `--ui-input-text-*`.
  - If you consumed `design-tokens` JSON directly, re-read dimension values as
    native DTCG `{ value, unit }` objects and font weight/family as scalars; the
    `$extensions.com.acronis.units` carrier no longer exists.
  - The semantic tier file is now `tiers/semantics.json` (was `semantic.json`),
    and AI gradients live under the top-level `gradients.*` root.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#250](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/250) [`d3541f9`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/d3541f9c40c5d12f1c464ad68bf42709b89948e5) Thanks [@leonid](https://github.com/leonid)! - Fix the AI background gradient to run **left-to-right** (90deg) instead of
  top-to-bottom, matching the Figma design. The `background.ai` gradient transform
  in design-tokens carried a stale vertical matrix (`[[0,1,0],[-1,0,1]]` → 180deg);
  it is now identity (`[[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]` → 90deg), and `tokens-pd` is regenerated.

  The AI `Button` variant now always leads with the `Sparkles` icon before its
  label, matching the Figma "Ai" button, and sets `bg-origin-border` so the
  gradient covers the full button box (previously a 1px sliver of the gradient's
  opposite end showed on the left and right border edges).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/221) [`848c600`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/848c60036c7591cf1d1ab01996147660c3cca7d5) Thanks [@heygabecom](https://github.com/heygabecom)! - Rename the token-source directory `tokens/` to `tiers/`.

  The three token files now live under `tiers/` instead of `tokens/`, matching
  the "Tier" vocabulary (primitives / semantics / components) used throughout the
  package docs and glossary. Nothing about the token data, shape, or values
  changed — this is purely the directory name and the paths that point at it.

  **BREAKING (subpath exports):** the package `exports` subpaths moved with the
  directory. Update any imports:
  - `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tokens/primitives.json` → `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tiers/primitives.json`
  - `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tokens/semantic.json` → `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tiers/semantic.json`
  - `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tokens/components.json` → `@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tiers/components.json`

  A translation tool that globs the package (e.g. Style Dictionary
  `source: ['node_modules/@acronis-platform/design-tokens/tiers/*.json']`) must
  point at `tiers/` and match the new path in any file-pattern parser
  (`/\/tiers\/.*\.json$/`).

  Also updated alongside the rename so the package stays consistent:
  - `package.json` — `files` (`tiers/**`), the `exports` map, and the `validate`
    script's `-d` token-file paths.
  - `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `context/*.md` — every
    reference to the source directory and the worked Style Dictionary example.
  - `.tmp/scripts/*.mjs` Figma-sync emitters and `lib/typography-map.mjs` — output
    paths and comments now write/refer to `tiers/` (the `.tmp/figma-tokens/`
    snapshot directory is unaffected).
  - `tools/style-dictionary` (private, not published) — `src/tokens.ts` source
    import paths and its `AGENTS.md` build-trigger table.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#98](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/98) [`23b62d4`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/23b62d49263276956b46d34cdd084003c9fd566b) Thanks [@heygabecom](https://github.com/heygabecom)! - Full Figma → tokens re-sync. Regenerated `primitives.json`, `semantic.json`, and
  `components.json` from the current Figma state via the documented sync workflow
  (`context/figma-sync.md`). The JSON now mirrors Figma exactly; removed/renamed
  paths were accepted rather than aliased.

  **Added**
  - `components.button.icon.*` (16) — new icon-button color group: `background` /
    `border` / `icon` / `label` × `idle` / `hover` / `active` / `disabled`,
    mirroring the `ghost` group. (Backs the Figma `ButtonIcon` component, which was
    rebound to these variables.)
  - `components.switch.*` (16) — switch promoted to its own top-level component
    (`background` / `border` / `circle` states + `units.*`), moved out of `form`.
  - `components.item.*` (~30) — expanded successor to `sub-item` (adds `gap-x` /
    `gap-y`, `height-min`, `padding-x-small`).
  - `components.form.{background,border,icon,circle,units}.*` (~30) — restructured
    form tokens with a sized scale (`sm` / `md` / `lg` / `xlg`).
  - `colors.focus.{brand,error,primary,secondary}` (4) — new focus-ring colors.
  - `typography.{body.form-label, link.default, link.default-underline, link.strong,
link.strong-underline}` (5).

  **Changed values**
  - **`brand-b` is now authored (teal).** 25 `semantic.colors.*` tokens flipped
    their `brand-b` mode from `{palette.blue.*}` to `{palette.teal.*}`; the
    `acronis` mode is unchanged. Previously `brand-b` mirrored `acronis`; designers
    have now given it its own palette. This also refreshes 29 `components.button.*`
    values that alias those semantics.
  - `palette.blue.7` dark-mode lightness `45.1 → 54.9` (light mode unchanged).
  - `button._global.padding-x` and `button._global.radius` updated.
  - Typography: `note.default` / `note.heading` now alias `{font.font-size.11}`
    instead of an inline `11px`; `headings.display` letter-spacing refreshed.

  **Changed metadata**
  - `units.stroke.3` is now scoped to **`EFFECT_FLOAT`** only
    (`$extensions.com.figma.scopes`); previously it also carried `STROKE_FLOAT`.
    The token value is unchanged — this only affects which Figma properties the
    variable is offered for.

  **Removed / renamed (breaking for consumers of the old paths)**

  These paths no longer exist in Figma. Most are renames — migrate references:
  - `form.input.*` → `form.background` / `form.border` / `form.icon.*` (same values).
  - `form.switch.*` → top-level `switch.*` (same values).
  - `form._global.*` → `form.units.*` — not 1:1; single values replaced by the
    sized scale (e.g. height `32` → `units.height-lg` `48`, radius `4` →
    `units.radius-lg` `24`).
  - `sub-item.*` → `item.*` (values largely identical; some `brand-b` values differ
    due to teal authoring).
  - `typography.body.link`, `typography.body.strong-underlined`,
    `typography.link.primary`, `typography.link.secondary` → renamed under
    `typography.link.{default,default-underline,strong,strong-underline}`.

  No successor (genuinely dropped): `sub-item.gap` (split into `item.gap-x` /
  `item.gap-y`), `sub-item.height-header`, `sub-item.width-collapsed`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/94) [`9e418d6`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/9e418d6fb7e4e52182e96dc26418daf82fde8c25) Thanks [@leonid](https://github.com/leonid)! - Add Figma Code Connect support to `ui-react` and align the Button with the
  Figma "Button" component.
  - **`ui-react`**: new Figma Code Connect setup (`figma.config.json`,
    co-located `*.figma.tsx` files, `figma:connect*` scripts) linking
    components to their Figma counterparts. The `Button` is fully connected and
    its variants now match the Figma `Style` set: added `ai` (gradient) and
    `inverted` variants, and re-pointed `default` / `secondary` / `ghost` /
    `destructive` to the colors used in the mockup via button-local
    `--color-btn-*` token bridges (the shared `--color-*` tokens are unchanged).
    The legacy-only `outline` / `link` / `translucent` variants are retained for
    parity with the shared demos.
  - **`design-tokens`**: added the `colors.background.inverted-surface` semantic
    tokens (idle / hover / active / disabled) that back the inverted button.
  - **`design-theme`**: emits the new
    `--av-colors-background-inverted-surface-*` custom properties.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

Update your dependencies and imports to the new package names.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#77](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/pull/77) [`bd04411`](https://github.com/acronis/uikit/commit/bd0441158c54f08acbd99f67648a98af025089f1) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Add the `@acronis-platform/design-tokens` design-data package — DTCG-2025.10-conformant design-token JSON (primitives, semantic, components), validated with ajv against `schemas/tokens.schema.json`. Data-only (no build, no runtime API), consumed via its `exports` map.
